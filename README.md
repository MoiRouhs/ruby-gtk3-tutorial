# Getting started with GTK+ with the ruby-gnome2 Gtk3 module.

This is a ruby adaptation of the official tutorial for the C language that you can find at https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-getting-started.html.

GTK+ is a widget toolkit. Each user interface created by GTK+ consists of widgets. The Gtk3 module of the ruby-gnome2 project is an implementation of the ruby bindings for GTK+.

With Gtk3, Widgets are organized in a hierachy. The Gtk::Window widget is the main container. The user interface is then built by adding buttons, drop-down menus, input fields, and other widgets to the window.

If you are creating complex user interfaces it is recommended to use Gtk::Builder and its GTK-specific markup description language, instead of assembling the interface manually. You can also use a visual user interface editor, like Glade.

GTK+ is event-driven. The toolkit listens for events such as a click on a button, and passes the event to your application.

Here is the most basic example that illustrate the principles of widget hierarchy and events management:

```ruby
require "gtk3"

window = Gtk::Window.new("First example")
window.set_request_size(400, 400)
window.set_border_width(10)

button = Gtk::Button.new(:label => "Say hello")
button.signal_connect "clicked" do |_widget|
  puts "Hello World!!"
end

window.add(button)
window.signal_connect("delete-event") { |_widget| Gtk.main_quit }
window.show_all

Gtk.main
```
This tutorial will mainly be focused on the use of Gtk::Application, which is the best way to create an application.

## Basics
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-getting-started.html#id-1.2.3.5

To begin our introduction to GTK, we'll start with a simple signal-based Gtk application. This program will create an empty 200 Ã— 200 pixel window.

*    example-0.rb
```ruby
require "gtk3"

app = Gtk::Application.new("org.gtk.example", :flags_none)

app.signal_connect "activate" do |application|
  window = Gtk::ApplicationWindow.new(application)
  window.set_title("Window")
  window.set_default_size(200, 200)
  window.show_all
end

puts app.run

```
When creating a Gtk::Application you need to pick an application identifier (a name) and input to `Gtk::Application#new` as parameter. For this example *org.gtk.example* is used but for choosing an identifier for your application see this [guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/ChooseApplicationID).
Lastly `Gtk::Application#new` takes a `Gio::ApplicationFlags` constants as input for your application, if your application would have special needs (those constants can be replaced by theirs respective symbol ie. `Gio::ApplicationFlags::NONE` == `:flags_none`).

Next we add instructions for the "activate" event of the `Gtk::Application` instance we created. The activate signal will be sent when your application is launched with the method `Gtk::Application#run` without argument on the line below (this is a specific case, see the part **A trivial application**). This method also takes as arguments a ruby array of string. This allows GTK+ to parse specific command line arguments that control the behavior of GTK+ itself. The parsed arguments will be removed from the array, leaving the unrecognized ones for your application to parse.

Inside the "activate" event block, we want to construct our GTK window, so that a window is shown when the application is launched. The call to `Gtk::ApplicationWindow#new` will create a new `Gtk::Window`. The window will have a frame, a title bar, and window controls depending on the platform.

A window title is set using `Gtk::Window#set_title`. This function takes a string as input. Finally the window size is set using `Gtk::Window#set_default_size` and the window is then shown by GTK via `Gtk::Widget#show_all`.

When you exit the window, by for example pressing the X, the `Gtk::Application#run` in the main loop returns with a number which is the exit status.

While the program is running, GTK+ is receiving *events*. These are typically input events caused by the user interacting with your program, but also things like messages from the window manager or other applications. GTK+ processes these and as a result, signals may be emitted on your widgets. Connecting handlers for these signals is how you normally make your program do something in response to user input.
The following example is slightly more complex, and tries to showcase some of the capabilities of GTK+.

In the long tradition of programming languages and libraries, it is called *Hello, World*.
*    example-1.rb
```ruby
require "gtk3"
app = Gtk::Application.new("org.gtk.example", :flags_none)

app.signal_connect "activate" do |application|
  window = Gtk::ApplicationWindow.new(application)
  window.set_title("Window")
  window.set_default_size(200, 200)

  button_box = Gtk::ButtonBox.new(:horizontal)
  window.add(button_box)

  button = Gtk::Button.new(label: "Hello World")
  button.signal_connect "clicked" do |widget|
    puts "Hello World"
    window.destroy
  end

  button_box.add(button)

  window.show_all
end

# Gtk::Application#run need C style argv ([prog, arg1, arg2, ...,argn]).
# The ARGV ruby variable only contains the arguments ([arg1, arg2, ...,argb])
# and not the program name. We have to add it explicitly.

puts app.run([$0] + ARGV)
```
As seen above, example-1.rb builds further upon example-0.rb by adding a button to our window, with the label "Hello World". Two new variables are created to accomplish this, button and button_box.

The button_box variable stores a `Gtk::ButtonBox` object, which is GTK+'s way of controlling the size and layout of buttons. The `Gtk::ButtonBox` is created with the method `Gtk::ButtonBox#new` which takes a `Gtk::Orientation `constant as parameter or the related symbols (`:vertical` or `:horizontal`).

The buttons which this box will contain can either be stored horizontally or vertically but this does not matter in this particular case as we are dealing with only one button. After initializing button_box with horizontal orientation, the code adds the button_box widget to the window widget using `Gtk::ButtonBox#add`.

Next the button variable is initialized in similar manner. The method `Gtk::Button#new` is called which returns a GtkButton to be stored inside button. A label is set using a ruby hash as argument :`:label => "Hello World"`.

Afterwards button is added to our button_box. Using the method "Gtk::Button#signal_connect" we add instructions, so that when the button is clicked, a message will be displayed in the terminal if the GTK application was started from one.

After that, `Gtk::Window#destroy` is called. This method is herited from `Gtk::Widget`. This has the effect that when the button is clicked, the whole GTK window is destroyed. More information about creating buttons can be found [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/Buttons).
The rest of the code in example-1.rb is identical to example-0.rb. Next section will elaborate further on how to add several GtkWidgets to your GTK application.

## Packing
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s02.html

When creating an application, you'll want to put more than one widget inside a window. When you want to put more than one widget into a window, it it becomes important to control how each widget is positioned and sized. This is where packing comes in.

GTK+ comes with a large variety of layout containers whose purpose it is to control the layout of the child widgets that are added to them. See [Layout Containers](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/LayoutContainers.html) for an overview.

The following example shows how the `Gtk::Grid` container lets you arrange several buttons:
*    example-2.rb

```ruby
require "gtk3"

app = Gtk::Application.new("org.gtk.example", :flags_none)

app.signal_connect "activate" do |application|
  # create a new window, and set its title
  window = Gtk::ApplicationWindow.new(application)
  window.set_title("Window")
  window.set_border_width(10)

  # Here we construct the container that is going pack our buttons 
  grid = Gtk::Grid.new

  # Pack the container in the window
  window.add(grid)

  button = Gtk::Button.new(:label => "Button 1")
  button.signal_connect("clicked") { puts "Hello World" }
  # Place the first button in the grid cell (0, 0), and make it fill
  # just 1 cell horizontally and vertically (ie no spanning)
  grid.attach(button, 0, 0, 1, 1)

  button = Gtk::Button.new(:label => "Button 2")
  button.signal_connect("clicked") { puts "Hello World" }
  # Place the second button in the grid cell (1, 0), and make it fill
  # just 1 cell horizontally and vertically (ie no spanning)
  grid.attach(button, 1, 0, 1, 1)

  button = Gtk::Button.new(:label => "Quit")
  button.signal_connect("clicked") { window.destroy }
  # Place the Quit button in the grid cell (0, 1), and make it
  # span 2 columns.
  grid.attach(button, 0, 1, 2, 1)

  # Now that we are done packing our widgets, we show them all
  # in one go, by calling Gtk::Widget#show_all on the window.
  # This call recursively calls Gtk::Widget#show on all widgets
  # that are contained in the window, directly or indirectly
  window.show_all
end

# Gtk::Application#run need C style argv ([prog, arg1, arg2, ...,argn]).
# The ARGV ruby variable only contains the arguments ([arg1, arg2, ...,argb])
# and not the program name. We have to add it explicitly.

status = app.run([$0] + ARGV)

puts status
```

## Building user interfaces
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s03.html

When construcing a more complicated user interface, with dozens or hundreds of widgets, doing all the setup work in code is cumbersome, and making changes becomes next to impossible.
Thankfully, GTK+ supports the separation of user interface layout from your business logic, by using UI descriptions in an XML format that can be parsed by the GtkBuilder class.

*    example-4.rb : Packing buttons with GtkBuilder

```ruby
require "gtk3"

builder_file = "#{File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))}/builder.ui"

# Construct a Gtk::Builder instance and load our UI description
builder = Gtk::Builder.new(:file => builder_file)

# Connect signal handlers to the constructed widgets
window = builder.get_object("window")
window.signal_connect("destroy") { Gtk.main_quit }

button = builder.get_object("button1")
button.signal_connect("clicked") { puts "Hello World" }

button = builder.get_object("button2")
button.signal_connect("clicked") { puts "Hello World" }

button = builder.get_object("quit")
button.signal_connect("clicked") { Gtk.main_quit }

Gtk.main
```

Here is the "builder.ui" file that describes the interface:

```xml
<interface>
  <object id="window" class="GtkWindow">
    <property name="visible">True</property>
    <property name="title">Grid</property>
    <property name="border-width">10</property>
    <child>
      <object id="grid" class="GtkGrid">
        <property name="visible">True</property>
        <child>
          <object id="button1" class="GtkButton">
            <property name="visible">True</property>
            <property name="label">Button 1</property>
          </object>
          <packing>
            <property name="left-attach">0</property>
            <property name="top-attach">0</property>
          </packing>
        </child>
        <child>
          <object id="button2" class="GtkButton">
            <property name="visible">True</property>
            <property name="label">Button 2</property>
          </object>
          <packing>
            <property name="left-attach">1</property>
            <property name="top-attach">0</property>
          </packing>
        </child>
        <child>
          <object id="quit" class="GtkButton">
            <property name="visible">True</property>
            <property name="label">Quit</property>
          </object>
          <packing>
            <property name="left-attach">0</property>
            <property name="top-attach">1</property>
            <property name="width">2</property>
          </packing>
        </child>
      </object>
      <packing>
      </packing>
    </child>
  </object>
</interface>
```

The usage of the `Gtk::Builder` is really easy, we just create an instance from the
file "builder.ui" with `Gtk::Builder.new(:file => builder_file)`. Then you can access every widget or part of the interface thanks to its name: `window = builder.get_object("window")`. Note that `Gtk::Builder` can also be used to construct objects that are not widgets, such as tree models, adjustments, etc.

The XML definition of the interface can be loaded from a file, a string or a path in a gresource binary. More informations related to this XML definition can be found [here](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkBuilder.html#BUILDER-UI). Those files are generally built with [glade](https://glade.gnome.org/). 


## Building applications

### A trivial application
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s04.html#id-1.2.3.12.5

*    exampleapp1.rb
```ruby
require "gtk3"

class ExampleAppWindow < Gtk::ApplicationWindow

  def open(file)
    
  end
end

class ExampleApp < Gtk::Application
  def initialize
    super("org.gtk.exampleapp", :handles_open)

    signal_connect "activate" do |application|
      window = ExampleAppWindow.new(application)
      window.present
    end
    signal_connect "open" do |application, files, hin|
      windows = application.windows
      win = nil
      unless windows.empty?
        win = windows.first
      else
        win = ExampleAppWindow.new(application)
      end

      files.each { |file| win.open(file) }
        
      win.present
    end
  end
end

app = ExampleApp.new

puts app.run([$0]+ARGV)
```

In this example we create a subclass of `Gtk::Application` called ExampleApp. In the `ExampleApp#initialize` method, we add instructions for two signals *activate* and *open*. Every `Gtk::Application` object or its subclass object can react to 4 signals:

*    startup : sets up the application when it first start
*    shutdown : preforms shutdown tasks
*    activate : shows the default first window of the application
*    open : opens files and shows them in a new window

For more informations, see [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GtkApplication).
In this case, the signal "*activate*" will be triggered if no arguments are given to the `ExampleApp#run` method. And a default window will be created and will be presented to the user ( [see](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWindow.html#gtk-window-present).

If file names are given to the `ExampleApp#run` method, then it is the "*open*" signal that is called.
Trought this event, you can manage the files that are stored in an array of `Gio::File` objects.

In this example, each files are used by an `ExampleAppWindow#open` method. The `ExampleAppWindow` class is derived from the `Gtk::ApplicationWindow`.

This does not look very impressive yet, but our application is already presenting itself on the session bus, and it accepts files as commandline arguments.
